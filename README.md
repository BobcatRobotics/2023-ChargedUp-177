Need to test SwerveAutoBuilder in RobotContainer to fully build the commands and test like that. If that doesn't work, we can still try with PPSwerveControllerCommand. Either one of those allow for reflections across alliances and simplify the code to work without the DriveFollowCommand hassle and explicitly defining the classes without the event map. Otherwise, we work with what we have.
